             <p>Metallica is an American heavy metal band.
                 The band was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles by vocalist/guitarist
                  James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, and has been based in San
                   Francisco for most of its career.[1][2] The band's fast tempos, 
                   instrumentals and aggressive musicianship made them one of the 
                   founding "big four" bands of thrash metal, alongside Megadeth, 
                   Anthrax and Slayer. Metallica's current lineup comprises founding
                    members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime 
                    lead guitarist Kirk Hammett, and bassist Robert Trujillo. 
                    Guitarist Dave Mustaine (who went on to form Megadeth after
                     being fired from the band) and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff 
                     Burton (who died in a bus accident in Sweden in 1986) and Jason
                      Newsted are former members of the band.</p>
                     
            <p>Metallica has released ten studio albums, four live albums, a cover album,
            five extended plays, 37 singles and 39 music videos. The band has won nine
            Grammy Awards from 23 nominations, and its last six studio albums (beginning
            with Metallica) have consecutively debuted at number one on the Billboard
            200. Metallica ranks as one of the most commercially successful bands of 
            all time, having sold over 125 million albums worldwide as of 2018. 
            Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time 
            by magazines such as Rolling Stone, which ranked them at no. 61 on its 
            100 Greatest Artists of All Time list.[4] As of 2017, Metallica is the 
            third best-selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking 
            sales in 1991,selling a total of 58 million albums in the United States.
            Metallica has become one of the most influential heavy 
            metal bands of all time, and is credited as one of the "big four" of thrash
            metal, along with Slayer, Anthrax, and Megadeth.[222] The band has sold more
            than 125 million records worldwide,[3] including an RIAA-certified 66 million
            and Nielsen SoundScan-reported 58,000,000 in the US, making Metallica one of
            the most commercially successful bands of all time.[223][224]</p>
